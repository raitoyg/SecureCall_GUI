# SecureCall_GUI
<br>
Technology:<br>
+Node.js<br>
+Peer.js<br>
+Angular<br>
+Electron<br>
Disclaimer: I use Electron to convert the web version to a Linux/Debian desktop app.<br>
This is the desktop version of SecureCall, that allow 2 people to talk to each other. I buld this to create a more secure channel of communication for other stuffz.<br>
The peerjs server is the default one so you SHOULD change it to one off your privately owned server.<br>
Because the demo is using the public rtc server to generate tokens stability is questionable. If you are having trouble generating a token, try using a VPN and spoof your location to USA or Europe.
<br>
INSTALLATION:
1. git clone https://github.com/technich214/SecureCall_GUI<br>
2. ./SecureCall<br>
TUTORIAL:<br>
1. Wait for the token to be generated
2. Send the generated tokens to your friends
3. Ask your friend to use the token to initiate a connection

5. Press CALL to start a call, you can also send messages and stuff
