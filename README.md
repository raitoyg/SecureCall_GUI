# SecureCall_GUI
<br>
Technology:<br>
+Node.js<br>
+Peer.js<br>
+Angular<br>
+Electron<br>
<br>
<br>
Disclaimer: I use Electron to convert the web version to a Linux/Debian desktop app.
<br>
<br>
This is the desktop version of SecureCall, that allow 2 people to talk to each other. I buld this to create a more secure channel of communication for other stuffz.<br>
<br>
The peerjs server is the default one so you SHOULD change it to one off your privately owned server.<br>
Because the demo is using the public rtc server to generate tokens stability is questionable. If you are having trouble generating a token, try using a VPN and spoof your location to USA or Europe.
